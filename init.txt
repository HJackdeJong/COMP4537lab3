Step 1: Set Up the Node.js Project
Initialize a Node.js project (if not already done) using npm init.
Install the necessary packages, such as express for creating the server.

Step 2: Create the File Structure
Create the following files:
server.js: The main server file.
./modules/utils.js: This will contain the getDate() function.
./locals/en/en.js (or en.json): This will store the user-facing string.

Step 3: Define the Route in server.js
Set up an Express server.
Define a GET route that will handle requests coming to the server (e.g., /getDate).
Use query parameters to extract the name sent in the address bar (req.query.name).

Step 4: Handle the GET Request
In the GET route, retrieve the name parameter from the request.
Import the getDate() function from utils.js.
Import the string template from the en.js or en.json file.
Use the getDate() function to get the serverâ€™s current date and time.

Step 5: Format the Response Message
Replace placeholders in the string template with the name and server's current date/time.
Format the message with in-line CSS to display it in blue (server-side styling).

Step 6: Send the Response
Send the formatted message as a response to the client (browser).

Step 7: Test Locally
Run the server locally using Node.js and test the API by entering a URL with the name query parameter into the browser's address bar.

Step 8: Host the Server Remotely
Choose a remote hosting platform that supports Node.js (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Deploy the server code to the remote hosting service.
Ensure the API endpoint is available over HTTPS.

Step 9: Test the Deployed API
Access the deployed API using a browser by entering a URL like https://yourDomainName.xyz/COMP4537/labs/3/getDate/?name=John.
Verify that the response contains the name and the server's current date and time, with the message displayed in blue.
